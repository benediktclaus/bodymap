\title{Body Region Map for Anatomical Visualizations}
\format{
A simple features (sf) data frame with 14 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Integer. Unique identifier for each body region following a
    systematic coding scheme: IDs starting with \code{10xx} represent
    anterior (front) view regions, while IDs starting with \code{20xx}
    represent posterior (back) view regions. The last two digits further
    differentiate regions within each view.}
  \item{NAME}{Character. Name of the body region. Possible values are:
    "Head", "Face", "Chest", "Belly", "Back", "Upper Right Limb",
    "Upper Left Limb", "Lower Right Limb", "Lower Left Limb", and "Genitals".
    Note that "Head" appears twice (front and back view) and "Back" appears
    four times for different spinal regions.}
  \item{SUBREGION}{Character. Anatomical subregion classification, primarily
    used for the back/spine. Values include: \code{"Cervical"} (neck/upper spine),
    \code{"Thoracic"} (mid-back), \code{"Lumbar"} (lower back), \code{"Sacrum"}
    (pelvic region), or \code{NA} for regions without further subdivision.}
  \item{geometry}{sfc_MULTIPOLYGON. Simple features geometry column containing
    the spatial multipolygon data for each body region. Coordinate range:
    x = [0, 95.8], y = [0, 150]. No coordinate reference system (CRS) is
    defined as the coordinates are arbitrary and optimized for visualization.}

\usage{
bodymap
}
\description{
A spatial dataset containing geometric representations of human body regions
for creating anatomical visualizations. This dataset is designed to map
frequencies, intensities, or other metrics to specific body parts, making it
useful for medical visualizations, symptom mapping, or displaying regional
data distributions.
}
\details{
The dataset uses the Simple Features (sf) standard and can be directly
plotted using \code{ggplot2::geom_sf()}. Body regions are represented as
multipolygons that can be styled, colored, or filled based on associated data.

\strong{ID Structure:}
The ID system provides information about the anatomical view:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{1xxx series}: Anterior (front) body regions
  \item \strong{2xxx series}: Posterior (back) body regions
}

\strong{Anatomical Coverage:}
The body map includes both anterior and posterior views. Some regions like
"Head" appear in both views (IDs 1010 and 2010). The back is subdivided into
four anatomically distinct spinal regions (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrum)
to allow for detailed visualization of spine-related data.

\strong{Coordinate System:}
The coordinate system is arbitrary and optimized for aesthetic visualization
rather than anatomical precision. The body map provides a schematic
representation suitable for data visualization purposes. No geographic CRS
is defined.
